MIDI Dashboards for FL Studio

## Notices
The .fst files were generated using FL Studio 12.1.2 and I unfortunately can't guarantee they will work on older versions of the program, with or without modification. Sorry, FL 11 users.

## Prerequisites
- FL Studio with "Dashboard" plugin installed

## Setup
Make note of your FL Studio installation path before continuing. e.g.: `C:\Program Files\Image-Line\FL Studio 12.1`

I wasn't able to get the .txt import method working on my version, so if it does for you, that's great.
### Dashboards (working)
- Download the .fst file for the Dashboard you want to use and move it to `Data\Patches\Plugin presets\Generators\Dashboard`
- Download the corresponding .ins file for the instrument from the `Instruments` directory of this repo and move it to `Plugins\Fruity\Generators\Dashboard\Artwork\Instruments`
- Open FL Studio and add a Dashboard to your project
- Open the plugin options (drop-down arrow on the left side of the title bar) and your Dashboard should appear under the "Presets" menu. Click the desired Dashboard to load it.
### Dashboards (alternate, for older versions)
- Download the .txt file for the Dashboard you want to use
- Download the corresponding .ins file for the instrument from the `Instruments` directory of this repo and move it to `Plugins\Fruity\Generators\Dashboard\Artwork\Instruments`
- Open FL Studio and add a Dashboard to your project
- Open Dashboard's drop-down menu, then "Import from text file"
- Navigate to where your text file is stored, open it, and cross your fingers it imports without any errors
### Instrument Files
- Download any instrument files you want to use and move them to `Plugins\Fruity\Generators\Dashboard\Artwork\Instruments`
- Open FL Studio and add a Dashboard to your project
- With the Dashboard editor open, under the "Other" section, change the Instrument to the one you wish to use.
- Open Dashboard's drop-down menu, then Add Control > Patch Selector > Instrument Selector
- Add any other controls you wish to use
